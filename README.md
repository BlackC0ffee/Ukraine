Welcome to alpha-Two. This release provides a buggy but workable version of my mapping application I use to report over the situation in Ukraine. It still requires clean-up of code and allot of features needs to be added.

Yes, I know the code is a disaster, Iâ€™m planning to clean it up -_-

To run it. Install Docker and run the container from inside the root folder of the project.

```docker run -d -p 80:80 -v $(pwd)/Map:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx```

## Tools

**Select mode** If "ON" nothing can be edited on the map and a double click causes the polygon to be selected.

**Change Color** Provides an option to change the 'color' and side on the map.
1. Make sure an Active Polygon is selected (you can use Select mode if needed)
2. Click **Change Color**
3. Select the side or color
4. Click **Save**

### Edit mode

**Snapping:** If "ON", the closest existing polygon will be chosen
